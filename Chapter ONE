#confessions of Layla
This is a repo for my book
Dear Someone….,
Do you ever sit and think about your past just wishing that maybe if you did just one thing right then perhaps so much would be different? 
Do you have deep regrets? Well, I do. After all I am human. 
There’s me, the one that most of you know about and then there’s the ‘other me’ that very few know about but how about the ‘ME’ that only one person knows about? 
Do you keep secrets? If yes, is it because you are vulnerable? 
For how long do you think you can protect yourself? Or perhaps you’re simply comforting yourself that nobody knows. 
What if the one person you think doesn’t know, knows about it all? They say we all sin differently, that doesn’t make it right anyhow.
My name is Layla and I would love to make a confession. 
I am just one of the seven billion people in this world and like you all or perhaps most of you I share a strong bond with most people especially the friends I make. 
I try to live my life in the ways and teachings of my faith but just like yourself, I do wrong once in a while in the hope that ‘nobody knows’. 
‘Nobody’ and ‘somebody’ are the famous human characters that most of us fear.
I am a wife and a mother. 
While I deeply value the culture and tradition in which I was raised, I am also aware of the fact that I have failed to represent both my culture and my faith in a number of ways both knowingly and unknowingly. 
It is at this point that I wish to apologize to my creator, members of my faith, my community, my friends, my relatives, my parents, my siblings and mostly my husband and my two babies if my writing offends you in whatever manner.
